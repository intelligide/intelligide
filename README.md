## About me

I'm Yoann Potinet, a 24yo French (futur-engineer) living in Montreal, Quebec. I am passionate about automation and tooling. I wrote some tools to make life easier for developers. I'm a [Conan](https://github.com/conan-io/conan) and [Conan Center](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index) contributor. I advise you to use this great tool to facilitate your C++ development.

You can find more details regarding my education and employment history in [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoann-potinet/). I am looking for an internship and employment opportunities to complete my education. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on professional AAA games and game engines.

## Projects

### Unreal Engine

- [**Conan Unreal Generator**](https://github.com/FrozenStormInteractive/conan-unreal-generator): An experimental [Conan](https://github.com/conan-io/conan) generator for Unreal Engine 4 

- [**SignalR client for Unreal Engine 4**](https://github.com/FrozenStormInteractive/Unreal-SignalR): Use SignalR in Unreal Engine 4. It permits to communicate with SignalR server using websockets and RPC. It allows server to send asynchronous notifications to UE4 client.

- [**UE4 Bulk Renamer**](https://github.com/intelligide/ue4-bulk-renamer): An Unreal Engine 4 tool that allows you to rename several files at once. Similar to Advanced Renamer but for UE4, it uses Unreal engine Renaming API to edit file paths and keep the files linked together. It's extensible and you can add your own renaming rules.

### Unity

- [**Uniticons**](https://github.com/Bluemanoid/Uniticons): A free & open-source icon set inside an Unity package. It contains rasterized FontAwesome icons and update scripts.

- [**Blatand**](https://github.com/FrozenStormInteractive/Blatand): An Unity library to interact with Bluetooth devices. It uses device internal Bluetooth APIs. I developed it for a professional project, then I put it on Github under MIT license. It is now available as an Unity package.

- [**Hyper Switcher**](https://gitlab.com/intelligide/hyper-switcher): Reducing the time taken switching platforms by caching all data that has already been imported by Unity. On a multi-platform project, you often have to switch between platforms to test compatibility (and other reasons). But the larger your project gets, the longer the switch time becomes because Unity re-import each asset and it can become a serious setback in your development process. It's a free & open-source alternative to Turbo Switch PRO.

- [**Assimp for C# / Unity**](https://github.com/intelligide/assimp-unity): Use this Assimp package to load 3D model files in Unity at runtime.

- [**Unity I18n**](https://github.com/intelligide/unity-i18n): Localize strings on Unity. Take a look at the [official Unity localization package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.localization@0.8/manual/index.html) (but it's still in preview).

- [**Unitils**](https://github.com/intelligide/unitils): Some utilities for Unity.

- [**CMake Integration on Unity**](https://github.com/intelligide/UnityCMake)



### Others

- [**Chunked File System**](https://gitlab.com/FrozenStormInteractive/cfs)

- [**Spacescape**](https://github.com/FrozenStormInteractive/Spacescape): An open-source tool for creating space skyboxes with stars and nebulas for games. It's a fork of [petrocket's Spacescape](https://github.com/petrocket/spacescape). I try to enhance it with macOS & Linux support, CI pipeline, library updates, and more.

- [**Crunch2**](https://github.com/FrozenStormInteractive/Crunch2): It's a fork of [binomialLLC's Crunch](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/crunch), the Advanced DXTc texture compression and transcoding library. I used [Unity](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/crunch) and [DaemonEngine](https://github.com/DaemonEngine/crunch) improvements. I enhanced it with macOS support, CI pipeline, library updates, and more.

- [**OpenMatch C#**](https://github.com/FrozenStormInteractive/openmatch-csharp): Communicate with in C# with [OpenMatch](https://open-match.dev) services. I use it for the Athena project, a future backend platform for multiplayer games using dedicated servers.
